     <h2>Thin & Cloud Client Computing</h2>
        <p>Thin client computing has been one of our passions over the past few years and occupies an ever growing segment of our options. A thin, or cloud client, is usually thought of as a diskless computer – a desktop or laptop that connects to the Internet or server for services. As there are no moving parts to wear out, and a minimal operating system to care for, these devices last for years and years, and cost almost nothing to maintain – no updates, malware/virus programs, nor software to install.</p>
